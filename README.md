Name: My Sustainable Life
![Untitled (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8153656-0370-42d2-b941-2af097e70241)

My Sustainable Life is a lifestyle habit tracker with a focus on sustainability. Sustainability begins in the small choices we make in our everyday lives. These sustainable habits are promoted in My Sustainable Life via pre-determined sustainable task suggestions for the user to complete. The program incentivizes the users to stick to these habits via their own digital pet. Their pet's state is dependent on their adherence to their custom habits and/or the sustainable habits.

The home page contains an avatar - their pet - in the center with pop-ups surrounding. These pop-ups show categories of habits, each with a checklist of tasks the user can do to help their avatar (and themselves). If the user sticks close to the habits, their avatar will flourish. For example, if the user checks off a “compost” task, their avatar will gain health. When user does not stick to their habits, the avatar will dwindle. For custom habits, the pet will gain 1XP, for sustainable habits, 2XP.

At its core, this app combines the fun of a digital pet game with the benefit of using a habit tracker. The user will be encouraged to maintain their healthy lifestyles and be incentivized to weigh sustainability in the choices they make.
